1.0,"The old Aztec Hotel on foothill blvd, ( route 66) was a gem, back in its day. Unfortunately for the past ten years while the hotel was under poor management it was never maintained. The entire establishment is dirty and run down. The rooms are very small, which was typical for hotels during that era. Some staff are friendly, others were not willing to help when needed. Bar is a local hangout with a pretty good Band. The property needs a complete overhaul.",en,-0.05866013071895424,459,1

1.0,"Two positives: the front desk staff and the lobby. ALL downhill from there. Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER. I will never stay here again--for the same money you can stay at the EconoLodge next door--certainly no better, but how could it be worse",en,-0.016666666666666666,912,1

2.0,"I'll start this review by saying that Honua Kai is not a Hotel or a Resort. It's amazing that they charge a 25.00 resort fee, because this place is merely a Condominium Complex.

1.0,The manager uses foul language referring to poorly trained staff. Staff does not know how to issue credits after they fail to honor the rate quoted.

2.0,"The building looks beautiful the lobby too. They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms, 3 tvs and 2 baths! I was ecstatic at first. But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8. Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment!I lost count after that, but you get the idea. All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place.",en,0.22777777777777775,1055,1

Then I opened the closet door and discovered the garbage from a previous guest (ancient pizza in box, used plates, used napkins) stacked inside. Looked like it had been there a long, long time. It's amazing how fast your impression of a place can change. Wish the person at the desk had been a little more concerned about it when I told her.

1.0,"Terrible. I spent my last penny reserving my room and i didn't see anything about a deposit under the small print tab, so I thought I was all paid up. Suddenly, after having spent nearly half an hour checking-in with their highly unprofessional staff just before I was given my keys so I could go find my room, the room keys didn't work on my room. So I walked all the way to the lobby, this time with my bags in tow, only to find out that they deactivated my room keys because they weren't able to charge card for incidentals. Which is when I said, of course not...I spent my last penny reserving this place online and there was no mention of a deposit in your 'small print' tab online. Every room I've reserved through Hotels.com, that has charged me a deposit, mentioned a deposit or incidentals charge in their small tab. Well I cancelled my reservation and asked for my money back so I could rent another room elsewhere. The manager cancelled my reservation and stated that he would be refunding my money, but he never did. I was not able to rent another room...I was broke.",en,-0.11291666666666669,1079,1

The man at the desk keep stopping to help everyone who would walk in leaving us just standing there. Even if it was just talking to the random that were walking in. When we finally checked in, there was nowhere to park. People who had rooms on the other side of the hotel was parked on our side so we had no place to park. My husband had to pull behind someone to get our stuff out then drove it to the gasstation and asked if we could park there for the night and he had to walk back to the room. Also, there was a party going on in the next room which wasn't that big of a deal cuz they weren't loud or disturbing us but because of the party they had this man that stood in front of our door trying to sell us drugs as soon as we walked up. Everytime we walked out he kept on. I have a 10 year old daughter that was with us. Called the front to let them know of this man and the guy at the desk just laughed and said oh yea he's here often, he won't bother you. UM I'M CALLING BECAUSE HE IS BOTHERING ME.

There are multiple signs in the parking lot warning that the hotel is not responsible for any damage or theft and I was worried about my car being broken into.

Comfort is absent, there is no soundproofing in the rooms facing the street, nor in the back. The use of ear plugs is mandatory and probably insufficient to reduce continuous noise (day and night) from heavy duty air conditioning equipment of many commercial buildings surrounding the hotel.

When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay. After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay. On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance. I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in. After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning.

There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out.

While waiting to check in, I overheard the 2 gentleman in front of me, basically planning their party in the room they were getting and the reception told them where the liquor store was. The reception clerk was nice, and checked us in quickly. That was the best thing about this experience. My wife and I walked into the room and we're immediately hit with a terrible smell, and before we could complain the phone rang in the room, which was the reception desk calling to tell us that she should not have put us in that room because of the smell, and to come to the desk for new keys to a different room, which we obliged. We got our new keys and went to the new room, which smelled better, but looked sketchy, so we pulled back the covers on the bed to see ants crawling around. This was the moment we decided to check out and went right across the street to the Hampton Inn, which was great and highly recommended. We never stayed at this hotel and never will. All I needed was a clean bed to stay in for a few hours so I could catch a flight, but this hotel couldn't even provide that. In fact this hotel just seemed like a party spot for locals and would not feel comfortable even parking my car in the parking lot. It's really a shame that this hotel is like this.

Convenient to walk the short mile to Pike Place and also to savour many of the great restaurants in the neighbourhood. One negative comment is that there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel, so you could be waiting quite a while for the elevator to come to your floor if it was first thing in the morning and everybody was heading to breakfast.

The service and hospitality was amazing. The staff was courteous without feeling stuffy...the best way to describe them was authentic with a large does of Southern hospitality and they were all wonderful.They upgraded us to a better room which comprised of a wrap around view. The upgrade was complimentary even though they were fully booked. Two thumbs up and what a wonderful way to kick-off my birthday.The hotel bed is amazing. I described it as feeling hugged but not hot. I received the best sleep and my spouse said the same. I'm a side sleeper and he's a back sleeper so it's shocking that we both like the mattress.The bed was so comfortable that I emailed the hotel to get the make of the mattress and will order it for our own home.We frequented the lobby bar and the drinks were on point.I don't recall the name of my drink but it reminded me of salty plum but our bartender described it as vinegary. Personally, I thought it was well-balanced. The Frenchman was also well-made here. The rooftop bar was a scene but not compared to Orange County or LA. Much less pretentious and the skyline was pleasant.As others have mentioned, the hotel is not in the middle of the action but walking distance to Bourbon St and many of the best local restaurants (GW Fins being my fav for the grilled oysters and desserts).Bottom line, I would stay here again the next time we are in NOLA.Sara, thank you so much for choosing to stay at NOPSI! Its wonderful to learn that you had such a fun and memorable 40th birthday with us. We love making all occasions special, and were delighted to have won you over.

Two Hyatt Housers were on the desk - but only one working intake. I waited about 5 minutes to be checked in. Next was the size of the room - extremely small even for the room type. Next was the food service in the bar - absolutely the worst burnt cheeseburger I have had in quite a while accompanied by 16 broken potato chip pieces and a cupcake which was advertised to be scrumptiously fancy (it was not - it was plain awful and dry). Next was the shower - no water pressure (and this is a relatively new hotel). One of the better highlights was breakfast, while selection was limited - the food was good.Hyatt Houses are usually outstanding - evidently I caught the Seattle Hyatt House on Fifth Avenue during a underperforming period.ZAismy2ndHome,Feedback from our guests is very important to us and we appreciate the detailed concerns.

5.0,"My room was in a wonderful spot - near the elevators, near the gym, near the ice machine. The staff was very helpful. They gave very good suggestions about where to go during my short stay.

4.6,"Bad: Probably my oversight when Iread the description but I was surprised to find no mini fridge in the room. Good: Close to Colonial Williamsburg, clean with a friendly staff, and two great pools. The pools gave us downtime opportunity on a rainy day as well as on a sunny day.",en,0.27361111111111114,278,0

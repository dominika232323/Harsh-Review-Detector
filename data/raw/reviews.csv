534550,87124297,2016-07-18,12613393,"This apartment was in ideal location just a few minutes from Las Ramblas which was a lively fun area. The place was clean and very comfortable with air conditioning and lovely balconies, perfect for people watching. The area seemed safe and Alberto was very helpful in arranging transport from the airport and advising us on places to go and things to do. Overall the apartment was perfect for a first introduction to the wonderful city of Barcelona and we would highly recommend it. ",5
534550,466483244276311483,2021-10-05,420785919,"I was very surprised at the level of customer service Alvaro displayed. He explained everything worth knowing in detail when we arrived at the nocarz, including the prices we should be paying for transport to various places, the directions to different attractions in the city and good places to eat food. <br/>He gave us a detailed and thorough tour of our apartment and the rest of the amenities they offer.<br/>He was always there for us when we had any questions including assisting us in booking an antigen test before we flew out of Barcelona. <br/>The rooms were clean, spacious and well furnished, just like the pictures portray.<br/>The rooftop is high and gives you a nice view of the streets surrounding the apartment and beyond.<br/>The shower is of a good quality. You receive a hot and consistently strong stream of water.<br/>The beds were more than satisfactory; they were clean, comfortable and big (I’m 6ft 1).<br/>The balconies had strong sturdy doors and railing which made you feel safe.<br/>The only negative I can think of is it was a bit further than ideal if you want to walk into the city centre. Although, if you use the public bikes, it is not a problem at all. I cycled throughout the entire city during my time there.<br/>(Download the Donkey Republic app)<br/>Overall, a wonderful place to stay and will definitely be using again when I visit Barcelona next summer.",5

The cruise ship would not let us stay on the ship until check in but Carla kept our bags for us until we could get into the apartment. The apartment was spectacular! Large rooms, a fully outfitted kitchen, a refreshment center in the basement and a spectacular rooftop lounging area. There are restaurants really close by and the staff were so helpful in accommodating our American meal times. (Dinner is after 8pm.) I highly recommend staying here as they make vacationing so easy. Carla was very responsive and absolutely amazing to work with. Stay Together really made our stay in Barcelona the best part of our vacation!  Highly recommended.",5

Arian was a pleasure to deal with and the apartment was well located and extremely comfortable.<br/>Its location was ideal for visiting all areas of the city and was a wonderful place to return to at the end of an intense day of sightseeing.

The location was great, near lots of restaurants and the metro, with supermarket across the street.  An eclectic apartment with a funky old elevator and super comfortable beds. We loved having coffee on the balcony in the morning.  Air conditioning and washer/dryer were great.  Third bedroom a bit small, but still cozy and comfortable.  Definitely recommend!",5

256677,18011487,2014-08-20,15899927,"We would like to thank Petrutz and his wife (and Ruby, the very kind dog :) ) for their welcome. The apartment is well described: Confortable, clean.... The location is perfect. Very close to the Ramblas.<br/>Petrutz and his wife are very helpful and help us to feel at home.<br/>We recommend this place!<br/><br/>",5
256677,50016744,2015-10-08,42135531,"I am going to start with the negatives.<br/>- We had clearly communicated to the host that we will pack our luggage prior to checkout and pick it up late afternoon since we had a 7pm flight out. Despite this he demanded an extra 10 euros ( which we initially thought was for minor stain on the wall paint, but he clarified it was not) claiming it was for a late check out, knowing we were in a hurry to get to the airport and didn't have the time to argue. We had to be bullied n relent. This was not good! He blamed the communication gap on his English speaking skills which we felt was above average. Not done!!<br/>- He claimed that he is not charging us for the cleaning fee and that it is ""free"" for us. We know that cleaning fee is called out explicitly in the room rent charges. This was definitely deceit!<br/>- The room was equipped with an AC but the remote was not kept in our bedroom so he had to sleep in the heat n the street noise (opened the window). It was given the next day when requested but the blanket went missing n returned on persistence. This whole experience was very uncomfortable.<br/>Other comments:<br/>The place was as advertised and the room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The neighborhood/streets around aren't the cleanest but that didn't bother us much as this was expected in the ""old"" quarter of Barca. Petrutz or Pedro as he prefers to be called in Spain has sound knowledge of Barca and was helpful in guiding us with some transport options and local sightseeing. He helped us with the luggage up n down 4 floors which we appreciate. That was quite useful.",5

It is very convenient to multiple metro lines and close to the Aerobus stops. Fernando was an excellent host. Very responsive and easy to communicate with. We arrived on a Sunday evening when many things were closed, so he provided coffee, milk, bread, butter and jam so we would have something in the morning. I highly recommend Fernando's apartment!",5

Like not to be loud, to clean the bathroom with the special thing for glass, to look after her cat’s food and water, to keep the balcony opened because of the cat’s toilet etc. <br/>We followed all those rules, washed the dishes after ourselves, totally kept an apartment in a good way. Nothing was spoiled, broken, dirty etc. <br/>We agreed that we will check out at 12:00. <br/>Me and my friend are working on the photoshoots (as a stylist and photographer) and she knew that we came to make some work as well. In the morning we had a shooting day, so we had to prepare clothes, to iron it etc. We were in a hurry, because of small amount of time and made some mess in apartment, basically just some packages from the clothes laying on the floor.<br/>We had to leave Barcelona at 15:10. So, we partly packed our bags, to totally finish with them after the shooting.<br/>We came to the apartment at like 11:45 thinking that 10 minutes late for us to get ready and leave won’t be a big problem for the owner. BUT <br/>My friend opened the door with her key and got thrown in her with our big 20 kg bag. The owner was screaming, swore and throwing all of our clothes and other personal staff through the door to the staircase. This women just threw all our stuff together with the garbage (from the kitchen, bathroom etc. which we wold have to throw when we leave the apartment) and closed the door. God bless there weren’t any expensive or fragile stuff that could be broken. And the camera was with us. Would she compensate our losses if something is broken? Not sure…<br/>We were totally shocked and had to pack our baggage right on the floor. <br/>An old lonely senile women living with her 2 cats probably, needed a spectacle.",0
645513,3538959,2013-02-14,4531819,"Het is een plezierig appartement om te verblijven. We zijn uitermate vriendelijk ontvangen. We voelden ons er meteen thuis. Het apartement ligt op loopafstand van de boulevard en het strand. Er zijn prettige winkeltjes en restaurantjes in de buurt. Daardoor voel je je echt in Spanje! De Bus Turistic is nog dichterbij dan de boulevard en dus heb je alle bezienswaardigheden binnen handbereik. Ook op de hoek staan taxi's klaar en een fiets huren is ook op loopafstand. Kortom, een prima uitvalbasis om de stad te bezichtigen. Ook de conditie wordt op peil gehouden door de 60 treden omhoog! ",2

Location is in a nice quiet area and good in terms of transit accessibility and access to key locations - beach, Barceloneta, Gothic quarter, La Ramblas, El Born etc. The apartment is as depicted in the listing. Apartment has heater, fan, two single beds, a couch and very basic kitchen essentials. <br/>Stephane helped us with the check in and was very helpful. The communication overall was great. I had booked it from a day earlier erroneously, and our flight landed 3 hours late on the day of, but Stephane was very understanding and was very responsive in helping us with the check in. The crib provided didn’t have a mattress, but Stephane very quickly arranged one. I did have a chance to meet Marta and she is very sweet as well. <br/>The only reason I couldn’t give it a 5 star all the way is that there are small things (that one can live without, but the final mile that can go a long way in creating a good experience) such as not enough hand soap in the bathroom, no extra bedsheets, no dustbin in the bathroom, no line clips etc. Not that I bank on these solely, but in other places I have stayed the hosts generally offer a lot of tips, local guides maps etc., but didn’t get much in those terms. I understand that they manage a lot of apartments and hence may seem a little transactional in nature. <br/>But we had a great trip overall and wouldn’t mind recommending it to others!",5

We felt they did not like the hotel , but as a guest of a friend who had kindly left us his apartment. The apartments are very interesting feature , many different decorative elements. Aquariums with fish, flowers and birds on the terrace add atmosphere ( perhaps already hatched chicks ? I talked to them every morning :)<br/>David took care of breakfast (coffee , croissants, jam, butter , cereal , orange ) - it was very nice. In the comfort living room we had dinner every evening. The apartments have air conditioning and heating system that can be used if necessary. Two separate bedrooms tastefully decorated with a very (!!!) comfortable beds.<br/>The apartments are located in a residential area , not in the heart , but not so far - to Plaça Catalunya and Rambla we reached on foot. Near the apartment there are a lot of different shops (food , fruit, fish) and restaurants where you can dine .<br/>I highly recommend David's apartment for a pleasant stay in Barcelona and hope to stay in them again.<br/>And a few words for you, David . My friends and I are very grateful to you for your apartment! Thanks for the welcome meeting (unfortunately , my English allows me to basically listen than talk :) And we are always ready to help if you were going to spend a holiday in Russia. Welcome!<br/><br/>Для русских единомышленников:<br/>Сначала хочу сказать несколько слов для будущих гостей. Это действительно уютные, комфортные и приятные апартаменты. Мы ощущали себя не как в отеле, а как в гостях у друга, который любезно оставил нам свою квартиру. Апартаменты очень интересно оформлены, много различных элементов декора. Аквариумы с рыбками, а также живые птички на террасе добавляют атмосферы.<br/>Дэвид позаботился о завтраке (кофе, круасаны, джем, масло, мюсли, апельсины) – это было очень приятно. В комфортной гостиной мы ужинали всей компанией каждый вечер. В апартаментах есть система отопления и кондиционеры, которые можно использовать в случае необходимости. Две отдельные стильно оформленные спальни с очень (!!!) удобными кроватями.<br/>Апартаменты находятся в жилом квартале, не в самом центре, но и не так далеко – до пл. Каталониии и Рамблы мы доходили пешком. Рядом с апартаментами есть масса различных магазинов (продукты, фрукты, рыба) и ресторанов, где можно пообедать.<br/>Очень рекомендую апартаменты Дэвида для приятного отдыха в Барселоне!",5

The flat is very close to a couple of Gaudi's famous works; Casa Milla & Batlló. La Rambla is a 15 minute walk and beyond that, the beach is a further 15 minutes.<br/>The main train station, Barcelona Sants, is a 7 min taxi ride and the airport shuttle bus drops you a 10 minute walk away from the flat.<br/>Sid was easy to contact on the day of arrival and we were shown into the apartment without fuss. The room was clean with towels provided and a fan which was essential on one evening! The bathroom was clean and towels were provided. There was a problem with the wi-fi on the first day, but as we were out most of the day it was not a problem, but Sid quickly fixed it.<br/>I would recommend the apartment to anyone looking for a base to explore the city, who is happy to walk 15-20 minutes to some locations.",5

1343256,68864867,2016-04-07,48817538,"We were met at the apartment by Bianca as Rose was out of town. Initially there was a mixup about the meeting point as Bianca wasn't told that we would be waiting near the front door downstairs ( we didn't know the flat number at that time) but after a phone call, this was rectified. Bianca soon made us very welcome and showed us the amenities of the flat. She also gave us her contact details in case we needed her assistance.<br/>The flat is in a great location. Close proximity to the Sagrada Familia and also to the City bus tour stops. There are plenty of eateries and small shops nearby. We were able to find a SIM card for my iPad just across the road which was handy as the flat had no wifi even though there was a router there.<br/>The flat was clean and had most facilities that guests would need. It would be nicer if the curtains could be fixed properly as this would make the place look a lot more chic. A small extension cord would be useful as the cord from the kettle couldn't reach the under cupboard outlet on the bench. This meant we used the outlet in the cupboard and had to leave the door open to avoid steam build up. This is just a suggestion and not meant to be a criticism.<br/>Thank you for making the process of booking our first air BnB easier by answering our questions.",5

This place was perfect for that! <br/>Alejandro is also very supportive and within reach, since he also lives in the building. <br/>I know Barcelona quite well, so I was also looking for a more “catalan” experience. This is actually an upscale neighbourhood with its own vibrant lifestyle. I really enjoyed my stay! <br/>Highlights: <br/>- Easy access to other areas in the city. There are 4 subway stations close by: Padua, El Putxet, Muntaner and Lesseps. The fist two take less than 7 min. <br/>- 3 grocery shops across the street. One of them is bio/organic with lots of options for vegans/vegetarians. <br/>- A magical view of Tibidabo. Wait until the night falls! It’s a special treat of this place. <br/>- The small terrace is really sunny and cute.",5

2029507,152554319,2017-05-17,11463927,The apartment was AMAZING! One tip: Do not attempt to take a taxi going here because it is LITERALLY soooo close to Plaça Catalunya via Portal Del Angel. I also suggest taking this route for easier navigation with heavy luggage.<br/>The apartment is pristinely maintained. It has almost all the equipment and materials you'd need and you don't need to worry about lugging bags up a staircase because there's an elevator! (Thank God for the elevator). The apartment is spacious for three people and it could easily fit four to even five or six. The only thing is that there is almost no english channel (at the end we were able to find one with documentaries) and the hot water in the main bathroom sometimes gets faulty.,5

She also arranged a travel cot in the apartment for our baby at no cost which saved us having to bring one from home. Maria's apartment is spacious, clean, quiet and very centrally located - it was perfect for getting everywhere we wanted to go in the city. The main bed was very comfortable with good pillows - so important! overall the apartment was very comfortable and I'd recommend for anyone with a baby/kids. Only things to know are perhaps that the second bedroom is a bit tight on space for a cot so baby needs to be in the main bedroom with you, and also the balcony is accessed from the bedroom not the living room. Not great views but mainly good for smokers as Maria clearly states. The building has a lift but it is very small, so only good for small buggies/prams if you have children! We'd recommend Maria's apartment wholeheartedly, thanks Maria for being a great host.",5

The apartment is new and tastefully designed and decorated. Has everything that one can need, including the best shower we ever had at an nocarz (and better than most hotels) and an awesome terrace. Moreover, Laia kindly provided baby gear so we didn't have to schlep around too much stuff. They even replaced our towels with clean ones half way through the stay, which is a great touch. <br/>The only thing to note is that there are 20-25 stairs to get to the elevator, which we didn't expect and sucked a bit with a stoller, so if you have kids or accessibility limitations you should know, but hey it's Barcelona and we need to be thankful for the existence of an elevator... Wasn't too big of a deal honestly. <br/>Bottom line, awesome stay at one of the best nocarzs we have stayed it. You won't regret booking it. ",5

The larger bed is two smaller beds together. The noise isn’t so bad, but noise from the other units is noticeable at times. Doors slamming, loud voices, etc. The AC was nice to have but the unit had a slight musky smell… opening the windows solved that.

En caso de necesidad tambien hay un radiador y un split frio/calor, pero no fue necesario utilizarlo porque el ambiente era ideal y con amplias ventanas para ventilación. <br/>¡Lo recomiendo sin duda!",1

In the other double bedroom, another giant stain in the middle of the fitted sheet, along with dirt and hair on the fitted sheet. In the bunk room, there were crumbs all over the sheets. The floors were also completely filthy, so we swept and got up a huge pile of dirt, along with a dirty q-tip and a rusty nail in one of the bedrooms. We were incredibly disappointed to have dirty beds AND floors in our apartment. When I contacted the owner, they didn't seem to be concerned about our experience whatsoever, just saying they'd send someone in to clean again.

The roof top terrace was great to have an afternoon coffee and to enjoy the sun. The walls were not very thick so we could hear the neighbours through the walls (and probably they heard us!).

Anders als es in anderen Bewertungen zum Ausdruck kommt, habe ich den Check-In-Prozess als angenehm empfunden. Sofern man alle Daten in das – von Orobium nach Buchung des Apartments zur Verfügung gestellte – Onlineportal einpflegt, kann man am Anreisetag eine App auf sein Smartphone laden, mit dem man via Bluetooth alle Türen öffnen kann. Das Apartment war sauber und die Lage im angesagten Stadtteil Gracia genial. Es handelt sich um einen gewerblichen Vermieter, sodass noch eine Kurtaxe fällig wird, die gesondert zu bezahlen ist. Diese hat in unserem Fall 49.50 EUR betragen. Als einzigen Minuspunkt will ich erwähnen, dass im Erdgeschoss zeitweise äußerst feierwütige Gäste zu Gast waren, sodass es in der ersten Nacht leider recht laut war. Der größte Pluspunkt war hingegen, dass uns das Apartment sehr sauber überlassen wurde.",0

The house itself is better than the pictures. We were so comfortable and it had everything you could need. Marta is a fantastic host and had recommendations for everything.

There was lots of noise from the surrounding corridors, the glass lift was opposite the bedroom window & the blinds in the room were really flimsy gauze so the light from the hallways & lift made the room bright all night & I didn't sleep well.

Wasn’t sure why that was there, certainly didn’t add to the space.<br/>At night noise levels is quite loud. You can literally hear everything outside on the street traffic, such as the engines of buses, trucks and nearby pedestrians. The windows did nothing in terms of sound proofing. <br/>Lastly I noticed a small puddle in the room that looks like it leaked from the other room next to mine. <br/>Overall wasn’t a pleasant experience, but it got me through the trip.",4

Her English is not that good, but we managed to figure out what she was trying to say all the time.<br/>The location of the appartment is really nice for a citytrip. A lot of highlights are in walking distance and also public transport is nearby to get you everywhere you wanna go.<br/>Unfortunately we have some negative things about the appartment itself:<br/>- the host and her friends are smoking inside the kitchen, which we did not like. Also, the kitchen has got a really gross smell. <br/>- the bedroom does not have an airco so it was really hot sleeping there. <br/>- the bathroom is ok, but small. When you turn around in the shower, you are always hitting the button thay regulates that strength and the temperature of the shower. The advertisement on the nocarz website says you have 1.5 bathroom, which is not the case.<br/>- apparently she rents another room in the same house, a thing we did not know about when going to this appartment. Halfway our vacation she texted us with the question if we could pick up our shampoo and towels etc because of the other guests that were renting the other room. We had to share the bathroom with them, which is something we could not make up from the advertisement. So 1.5 bathroom for yourself really is not the case, actually you have to share the small bathroom with other guests.<br/>- all rooms cannot be locked, both the bedrooms and the bathroom. We were okay with that, but when we found out about the other guests we had to share the bathroom with, we didn't feel comfortable about this. Also the bedrooms cannot be locked, which we find is really weird since the other guests can theoretically just walk in and steal stuff when you are not at the appartment. When we asked Eucari about it, she told is that having locks for rooms is very uncommon in Spain. Nevertheless, Eucari's room is the only room that has a lock on it so we thought the whole lock-story was really weird when more guests are staying at the same appartment.<br/>So in conclusion, we really liked Eucari and the location of the appartment. The appartment has got everything you need for a citytrip, but we have some negative experiences about it.",4

Nobody goes to Barcelona for pizza but I assure you, it’s worth it.

I'm from Barcelona; as were my  parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, as far back as I remember! I am a lover of my city, but of the original city of Barcelona, the whole gothic and Eixample area is spectacular!

I worked previously in communication and creativity, but for some time now I decided to use all my creativity in creating furniture and decoration. Restore anything that people do not want as they think it is useless or old or broken, I look for new uses for them so that they don’t die and remain among us.

I am delighted and 100% available to give directions and suggestions about my city! Here I´ll give you the first, advice... watch your bag! Catalans are very good people, but we also have one or two thieves…well, many actually !
 
I hope you ll feel at home in my apartment and enjoy very much the city!

See you soon!!

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

If you have any questions, want to hear about an apartment or just say hi, don´t hesitate to reach out :)

Have a great day!

I'm from Barcelona; as were my  parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, as far back as I remember! I am a lover of my city, but of the original city of Barcelona, the whole gothic and Eixample area is spectacular!

I worked previously in communication and creativity, but for some time now I decided to use all my creativity in creating furniture and decoration. Restore anything that people do not want as they think it is useless or old or broken, I look for new uses for them so that they don’t die and remain among us.

I am delighted and 100% available to give directions and suggestions about my city! Here I´ll give you the first, advice... watch your bag! Catalans are very good people, but we also have one or two thieves…well, many actually !
 
I hope you ll feel at home in my apartment and enjoy very much the city!

See you soon!!

This modern area of Barcelona was designed by Catalan civil engineer Cerda in the mid 18th century as the old town area was starting to burst at its medieval seams.  Its geometric layout and broad, sunny streets are a pleasant contrast to the labyrinthine feel of the older parts of the city. <br /> <br />The wealthy elite of Barcelonese society were keen to make their mark on this new town, and commissioned some of the most in vogue architects of the day to design their homes.  As a result, Eixample boasts the most concentrated example of Modernista architecture in Barcelona.  As you are wandering around, don't look at your feet.  Peek into doorways and patios and glance up at street lamps and balconies - you'll see lots of little Modernista touches that all go towards creating the atmosphere of the place.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/fbeeb552-995c-40fc-b227-438766af6d56.jpg,5264883,,Unique,2013-02-28,"Barcelona, Spain",,,99%,88%,f,,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/df3663fa-8c46-4a2b-82c3-d42d3a377066.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,45,86,,t,t,"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",l'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample,,41.38739,2.16417,Entire rental unit,,,,2 baths,,,,,,,,32,,365,32.0,365.0,,t,0,0,0,158,2025-03-07,2,0,0,,0,0,,2019-06-21,2023-09-30,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,,,f,,,0,0,0.03

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

Llevamos más de una década alquilando apartamentos a familias, grupos de amigos, parejas... y realmente siempre ha sido una experiencia muy gratificante para nosotros. Cuando viajamos con nuestros niños, o cuando podemos escaparnos un fin de semana solos, es la opción de alojamiento que más nos gusta. Tenemos independencia, comodidad, conocemos muchos anfitriones nos enriquecen con sus historias y consejos sobre la ciudad y vivimos la ciudad casi casi como un local más.

Nos gusta sentirnos a gusto cuando viajamos, por eso es lo que intentamos ofrecer siempre a nuestros huéspedes. Tenemos un pequeño equipo que nos ayuda para lograr una mejor atención y que se esfuerza por hacer de la experiencia lo mejor posible.

Nos gusta sentirnos a gusto cuando viajamos, por eso es lo que intentamos ofrecer siempre a nuestros huéspedes. Tenemos un pequeño equipo que nos ayuda para lograr una mejor atención y que se esfuerza por hacer de la experiencia lo mejor posible. 

Esperamos verte pronto! Y no dudes en contactarnos para lo que necesites.

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

Eixample is now characterised by its octagonal blocks and its grid-like pattern, with wide streets and both commercial and residential areas.

Eixample Izquierdo is delimited by the grand, Passeig de Gràcia, a paradise for shopping and dining, and Plaça d'Espanya, where the Montjuïc Magic Fountain and one of the biggest convention centres in Barcelona can be found.

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

Cuando viajamos con nuestros niños, o cuando podemos escaparnos un fin de semana solos, es la opción de alojamiento que más nos gusta. Tenemos independencia, comodidad, conocemos muchos anfitriones nos enriquecen con sus historias y consejos sobre la ciudad y vivimos la ciudad casi casi como un local más.

Nos gusta sentirnos a gusto cuando viajamos, por eso es lo que intentamos ofrecer siempre a nuestros huéspedes. Tenemos un pequeño equipo que nos ayuda para lograr una mejor atención y que se esfuerza por hacer de la experiencia lo mejor posible. 

Esperamos verte pronto! Y no dudes en contactarnos para lo que necesites.

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

If you have any questions, want to hear about an apartment or just say hi, don´t hesitate to reach out :)

Have a great day!

Eixample was designed by Catalan-born architect, Ildefons Cerdà, who took traffic and sunlight (amongst many other things) into consideration when drawing up the plans of the new area. Eixample is now characterised by its octagonal blocks and its grid-like pattern, with wide streets and both commercial and residential areas.

It is located on Gravina street, between Plaza de Cataluña and Paseo de Gracia in Barcelona. Our hotel is located close to the Ramblas of Barcelona and is without doubt an unbeatable location for the adventurous who want to explore the best corners of the city. 
Reding was born as an artistic movement that creatively and experimentally explores colour and its ability to evoke emotions. After years of exploration, the contrast between maroon and green and maroon and mustard on a limitless canvas allows you to experience an intense atmosphere of meditation and inner tranquillity and to feel immersed in an environment that favours the appearance of the desired effect, the Reding effect.
